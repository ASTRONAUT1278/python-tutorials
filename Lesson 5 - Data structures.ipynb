    "### **The head/tail attributes**\n",

    "The built-in methods `head(i)` and `tail(i)` access the first or last `i` elements of your `DataFrame`, e.g., `df.head(2)` will access the first two elements. This is useful when dealing with large datasets.\n",

    "### **Slicing a DataFrame**\n",
    "\n",
    "To access a desired slice of a `DataFrame`, we use a similar syntax that for `lists`. For example\n",

See [rotation curves](https://github.com/EXPLORE-for-students/python-tutorials/blob/main/Rotation%20curves/readme.pdf) for a detail description of the data files. In this exercise we will  practice our **pandas** skills on those files (They will also be used in Tutorial 6 using **classes**, and in Tutorial 7, when we discuss **interpolating function**).\n",

As explained in [rotation curves](https://github.com/keiwanjamaly/Python-Tutorials/blob/main/Rotation%20curves/readme.pdf), some of the measured errors (i.e. some values in `circ velocity error`) have been underestimated. In this step we will  include a systematic error at the level of 5% of the last measured velocity point (i.e. the last data point of column `cir velocity` in our `df_circular`). Add a new column in `df_circular` called `syst error` whose values contain the systematic error. Then, add the new column  `total error`, containing the total error computed as the sum in quadratures of `sys error` and   `circ velocity error`. \n",
